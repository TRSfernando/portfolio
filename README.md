# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

This is my custom-built personal portfolio website designed to showcase my profile, resume, projects, and contact information — all in a clean, responsive, and modern layout. It was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, with icons powered by Iconify and typography from Google Fonts.
